[phasevoc~] is a phasevocoder extern for Pd by David Medine released under the GPL

building:
---------
Linux:
Drop the phasevoc_tilde folder into Pd's extra folder and hit 

> make

in a terminal. You can also specify the include path (needed to find m_pd.h) by typing:

> make PDPATH=<full path to pd's src folder>

where the full path is something like /home/dmedine/Software/pd-0.45-4/src 

Mac:
You will need to change the fourth line of the makefile from:

current: pd_linux

to:

current: pd_darwin

then, it's the same as for linux. The makefile uses the same variable PDPATH for both linux and mac build options, so the same deal applies.

installing:
-----------
You will also need to tell Pd where the extern is. If it is in the extra folder, you should be fine just renaming the folder 'phasevoc_tilde' to 'phasevoc~' otherwise you will need to add the path to Pd's path list, or declare the path using the [declare] object with the -path flag and the path to phasevoc~.pd_linux.
