[phasevoc~] is a phasevocoder extern for Pd by David Medine released under the GPL

installation:

Linux:
Drop the phasevoc~ folder into Pd's extra folder and hit 

> make

in a terminal. You can also specify the include path (needed to find m_pd.h) by typing:

> make LINUXINCLUDE=<full path to pd's src floder>

Mac:
You will need to change the fourth line of the makefile from:

current: pd_linux

to:

current: pd_darwin

then, it's the same as above. The makefile uses the same variable LINUXINCLUDE for both linux and 
mac build options, so the same deal applies.

You will also need to tell Pd where the extern is. If it is in the extra folder, you should be fine, 
otherwise you will need to add the path to Pd's path list, or declare the path using the [declare] object.
